Candace's Practice Project! üëè

## About
## -------------------------------------------
This project is broken and needs a web developer to come through and fix it up! I've made a list of things that need fixin'. Some of these things are easier than others. If you get stuck, try a different item on the list. :)

## TODO's
## -------------------------------------------
- [ ] The footer (information displayed at the bottom of the page), on the home page, has a phone number. Someone forgot to enter an actual phone number and instead left the placeholder "X's" there - change the X's to be a phone number.

- [ ] On the home page, clicking on the picture of the Goth family takes you to the Goth page, but clicking on the picture of the Landgraab family doesn't do anything. Make it take you to the Landgraab page. 

- [ ] When you click on the Goth family page, the "Goths" text in the Navbar is highlighted. When you click on the Landgraab page, the Landgraab text in the navbar is not highlighted. Make it highlight. **Note that a navbar is the bar at the top that let's the user navigate to different parts of your webpage. 

- [ ] On the Goth family page, when you click on the picture of Cassandra, add an alert that let's the user know that Cassandra is cool. Some helpful docs on alert: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp

- [ ] On the Goth family page, the title of the Chrome tab seems wrong. See what it is on the other pages and fix it. üí©

- [ ] On the Goth family page, you'll notice that the info text for Bella (below her picture) is missing; figure out why and make it show up. 

- [ ] On the Goth family page, the "Add Alexander To The Family" button doesn't do anything. Hook it up so that Alex displays next to Cassandra. (Alex is already written in the code, just need to display him üòÅ).

- [ ] Once you've added Alex to the family, make the "Add alex" button go away and show the "remove alex" button (already there but not displayed). You should be able to toggle Alex's display status.

- [ ] On the Landgraabs family page, hook up all the "Add Hobby" buttons so that when you enter a hobby, it displays in the person's hobby list below their picture. You'll notice that nancy and dudley's hobby input and buttons aren't there (comments in HTML?)...strange things afoot üòÖ

- [ ] Add the ability to remove hobbies from the Landgraabs page. Maybe an 'X' or garbage can icon next to each hobby that allows you to click it and delete it? ü§î

- [ ] Add a whole new SIMS family to the site. Allow the user to access the new family's page from the home page and the navbar. Make their page anything you want it to be!
